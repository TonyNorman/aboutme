      <h1> Where I'm From</h1>
      <p> I was born in Dallas, Texas and moved to a when I was four. The town where I grew up, Marshall, Oklahoma, had a population of 350. It was a great time in my life. I could go hunting and fishing anywhere I could walk within the span of a day. After high school, I moved to Austin, Texas to attend the University of Texas, where I graduated with a B.A. in psycholgy in 1988. After graduation, I moved to the Dalas/Ft. Worth area where I currently reside.

    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies</h2>
    <p>Right now my favorite hobbies consist of reading theological articles as I prepare to begin seminary in the near future. As well, I have made health a priority. As a result, excercise and a healthy diet are now an important part of my lifestyle. </p>
    
    <h2>What is my dream job</h2>
    <p>Short of working full time as a professional fly fisherman somewhere in Montana, I would say any job tht would allow me to express myself creatively. </p>
